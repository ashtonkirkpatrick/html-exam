                The <i>PowerBook Duo</i> (1992): The PowerBook 200 (a.k.a. the <i>PowerBook Duo</i>) was an early precursor to today's MacBook Air and ultrabook systems. It was the thinnest and lightest notebook computer on the market when it arrived. The PowerBook Duo is a line of subnotebooks manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from 1992 until 1997 as a more compact companion to the PowerBook line. Improving upon the PowerBook 100's portability, the Duo came in seven different models. Apple shaved weight and space from the design by eliminating many components and ports, including floppy or optical drives, support for external drives of any kind, any type of display connector, and the ADB port used for Apple keyboards of the time. The only ports included were a single serial port for connecting to printers and other peripherals and a proprietary docking port. (An internal modem was an option, as well). When Duo users wanted access to other ports, they relied on an optional docking station called the Duo Dock -- a device that resembled a cross between a desktop Mac and a VCR. When a Duo was inserted into a Duo Dock, it could act as a desktop Mac with a full set of ports and other components. The <i>PowerBook Duo</i> line continued for several years and was, in many ways, ahead of its time. After canceling the Duo, Apple released a minimalist notebook in 1997 called the PowerBook 2400 and, of course, in 2008 the sleek and popular MacBook Air.</font>
