            <p>The Macintosh 128K, originally released as the Apple Macintosh, is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer. A handle built into the top of the case made it easier for the computer to be lifted and carried. When Steve Jobs unveiled the <i>original Mac</i> on Jan. 24, 1984, he introduced the world to a new type of computing experience. Although GUI systems, including the Apple Lisa, had already been developed, the Mac was the first such system to be unveiled to the general public. Until then, such computers had largely been developed as experimental prototypes at labs like Xerox PARC or pitched to specific markets, often with a significant price tag. (The Apple Lisa originally sold for $9,995 -- in 1984 dollars.)The Original Mac ,2007, Commons.wikimedia.com </p></font>
